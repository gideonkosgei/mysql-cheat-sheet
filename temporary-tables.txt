a temporary table is a special type of table that allows you to store a temporary result set, 
which you can reuse several times in a single session

MySQL removes the temporary table automatically when the session ends or the connection is terminated. 
you can use the  DROP TABLE statement to remove a temporary table explicitly when you are no longer use it.

A temporary table can have the same name as a normal table in a database
if you create a temporary table named employees in the sample database, the existing employees table
becomes inaccessible
When you drop the employees temporary table, the permanent employees table is available and accessible.

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE table_name(
   column_1_definition,
   column_2_definition,
   ...,
   table_constraints
);

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table_name
SELECT * FROM original_table
LIMIT 0;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE credits(
    customerNumber INT PRIMARY KEY,
    creditLimit DEC(10,2)
);

drop temporary table
--------------------
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE table_name;
