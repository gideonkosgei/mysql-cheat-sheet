The EXISTS clause

The EXISTS clause is used to return output from the outer query if the inner query returns any results. 

SELECT region_name FROM region WHERE EXISTS
  (SELECT region_id FROM winery GROUP BY region_id HAVING count(*) > 35);

Whether you use the IN clause or the EXISTS clause is almost always a personal preference. 


SELECT DISTINCT wine_id FROM items WHERE cust_id IN 
  (SELECT customer.cust_id FROM customer 
   INNER JOIN orders USING (cust_id)
   GROUP BY cust_id HAVING count(order_id) >= 6);


SELECT DISTINCT wine_id FROM items WHERE EXISTS 
  (SELECT * FROM orders WHERE orders.cust_id = items.cust_id
   GROUP BY cust_id HAVING count(order_id) >= 6);
